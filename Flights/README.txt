HELLO GUYS, WELCOME BACK. IN THIS VIDEO, WE WILL APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING TO BUILD SHINY APPS FROM SCRATCH. WE WILL BEGIN BY DOING ANALYSIS AND THEN DESIGNING THE UI. THE ANALYSIS SCRIPTS WILL BE ON THE GITHUB REPO IN THE DESCRIPTION.

FOR THE SAKE OF TIME,I WILL ONLY PROVIDE THE CODE I USED FOR THE ANALYSIS.

IN THIS VIDEO WE WILL DEVELOP A DASHBOARD APP AS WE WILL SEE IN THE DEMO, WE WILL USE THE FLIGHTS DATA SETS FROM THE NYCEFLIGHT13 PACKAGE.

AM SORRY FOR NO AUDIO BECAUSE CURRENTLY I DO NOT HAVE A RELIABLE AUDIO SYSTEM I AM HOPING TO HAVE ONE IN FUTURE VIDEOS. 

THE CODE IS WELL COMMENTED.

LETS GET STARTED.

lets check out the demo.
